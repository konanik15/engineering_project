// LIST: 
// 1. user can create a lobby and it will automatically assign it to him (leader)    
// 2. there is a list of lobbies on the main page
//     2.1 the listed lobbies show if the game is in progress, the number of people in the lobby/maximum amount, the game that the lobby wants to play
// 3. in the lobby the users can ready themselves, if all players aren't ready the host can't start the game
// 4. after ending the game the players go back to the lobby and the history of chat is preserved??? that would be an additional thing
// 5. the host can kick users
// 6. the host can make the lobby private and maybe password protected



TODO:
3. start game function, related to 2, works I guess
    3.2. after coming back to lobby it can't be in progress anymore (this will be done after I connect db to lobby, so I can store everything in the db and after game ends players 
    can be redirected to the lobby with all it's history(only chat, who is leader and the players I guess))
5. to do
7. change game in the lobby

FIXME:
1. while refreshing on full lobby you get 404 lobby is full // not happening on firefox xd, chrome is trash
