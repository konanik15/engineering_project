* Frontend app is listening on 4200.

## TODO
### Keycloak
- configure sensible session and token expiration times for production later on, now they are practically endless for dev/debug purposes
- figure out how to set client secret so it's not hardcoded in the realm json file
- ~~figure out how to set up a docker healthcheck~~
